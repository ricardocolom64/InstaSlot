Launching the game takes you to the Title Screen. By pressing the Play button you are then taken to the Main Screen, where gameplay takes place.

Briefly, the game loop revolves around pressing the start button next to the lever to begin rolling the three slot columns, and by pressing stop the user can choose when to begin the slow down of the slots.

The user is given 1000 currency at the start, and they can test their luck by betting their currency on a spin.

The possibilities of items to roll on a spin are:
  * Apple
  * Banana
  * Cherry
  * Lemon
  * Bonus
  * Lucky 7
  * Special Item

Multiple end scenarios are possible:

All fruits have the same rarity, and landing on 3 of the same fruit grants a __Standard Win__.

A bonus item can take the place of any other item except a special item (think of it as a Wild card).

Managing to land on 3 Lucky 7's grants you a __Lucky 7 Win__, a very high multiplier on your previous bet.

A special item is exceedingly rare, though you only need 1 of them in any of the slots to grant you a __Special Win__.

If you manage to land right in between two rows of fruits, you will be granted a __Free Spin__.

Any other scenario would grant you a __Loss__, and you lose the currency you placed to bet.

A unique 3D graphic appears on screen for each of these end scenarios.

# Customization

Different skins are available to change both the visual presentation and sound effects of the slot machine cabinet.

These skins are:
  * Default
  * ShellHacks 2021
  * Christmas
  * Halloween

Skins change the background, look of the slot cabinet, start sound effects, and the look of the special item. The special item can be a __Star, a ShellHacks Shell, Christmas Present, or Jack o' Lantern__ depending on the current game skin.

# Other Information

This game was done in approximately 36 hours as part of the ShellHacks 2021 Hackathon. We hope that with more time we will be able to polish the game and make it as good as we can. Also, here's another look at the custom ShellHacks 3D Model we designed.
